This is a demo package for my blog post on [writing an R package from
scratch to CRAN](http://mikewk.com/post/2019-05-01-writing-r-package/).

``` r
## load package
library(myfirstpkg)

## use re_match function
re_match(letters, "[a-d]")
#>  [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" 
#> [18] ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""
```
